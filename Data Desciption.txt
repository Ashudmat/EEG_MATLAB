 Total there are 9 subjects.
 Each subject is performing 5 sessions.
 First two sessions are without feedback but the next three sessions are with feedback.
 So total number of files are 45 (9 subjects x 5 sessions)
 There are total 45 GDF(General Data Format) Files.
 The last two files (with feedback) of each subject is for evaluation.
 There is no need to use files for evaluation.
 It means we have to use 27 files.
 Each file have EOG(Eyes moments) at start except session B0102T and B0504E.
 Each files having different number of events and different number of runs.
 Each run having 20 trails.
 Out of 20 trails 10 trails are from class left and 10 from class right.
 All trails are randomly distributed.
 And the length of each trail is different.
 Sampling frequency is 250 Hz.
 Each file is containing signals for different electrodes but we have to extract data for C3 and C4.
